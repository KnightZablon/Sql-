SQL school project
Utilizing sql skills, the historical weather data from an api was organized into three layers within a snowflake environment. In the bronze layer, sql expertise was employed to efficiently load raw csv data into a snowflake table, ensuring all information was accurately captured and stored. The silver layer involved the creation of sql views,sql proficiency was crucial in selecting and transforming the data, reducing the number of columns while maintaining relevance for subsequent analysis. Finally, in the gold layer, sql skills were pivotal in aggregating data from the silver layer into summary tables, enabling advanced data analysis and insights. Throughout this process, sql queries were crafted and optimized to manipulate, extract, and organize the data effectively, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding and application of sql principles in data management and analysis.
